    AI’s rapid advancement and innovation potential across a range of fields is incredibly exciting.
	Yet a thorough and open discussion around AI ethics,
	and the principles organisations using this technology must consider, is urgently needed.

Dubai’s Ethical AI Toolkit has been created to provide practical help across a city ecosystem. 
It supports industry, academia and individuals in understanding how AI systems can be used responsibly.
Our aim is to offer unified guidance that is continuously improved in collaboration with our communities.
 The eventual goal is to reach widespread agreement and adoption of commonly-agreed policies to inform the ethical use of
 AI not just in Dubai but around the world.
 Artificial Intelligence has emerged as an increasingly impactful discipline in science and technology.
 AI applications are embedded in the infrastructure of many products and industries search engines
 , medical diagnoses, speech recognition, robot control, web search, advertising and even toys.
